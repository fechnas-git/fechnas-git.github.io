              Snake Snacks is a fun and quirky adaptation of the classic mobile
              game hit Snake. The idea emerged out of a desire to program a fun
              thing, so we brainstormed a bit. The idea that we ended up
              prototyping was Snake Snacks. Though it is still in a very basic
              state and pretty simple looking, playing the game is already quite
              fun! For Snake Snacks, I am the sole programmer with Lena
              providing ideas and concept art.

            <p>
              In Snake Snacks, instead of controlling the snake itself, you
              place the green snacks and the snake finds it's own way to it. The
              snake is not very smart though, and thus it's up to the player to
              guide the snake in a way to avoid enemies and obstacles. If no
              snack is present, the snake will continously move forward, even
              biting it's own tail or running into enemies if not distracted by
              the placement of a new snack. A round of Snake Snacks is short,
              fun and engaging!

            <p>
              The idea emerged out of a brainstorming for fun minigames to
              prototype as a pastime activity. It is simply built and contains
              no complex logic, but it works and it's fun, two main requirements
              for a good game in my book! On a more serious note, working on
              Snake Snacks was a fun exercise, and it turned out to be so
              promising that it might grow into a fully fledged mobile game in
              the future. So far in the prototype, although no graphics were
              implemented, there's already 2 types of obstacles and the basic
              gameplay is fully implemented.

            <p>
              The snake in Snake Snacks is not very smart. In fact, it is rather
              predictable: It will always move vertically towards the food and
              then horizontally, but never turn around 180 degrees. Not only is
              this pattern rather simple to implement, it is also simple for the
              players to follow, predict and plan their moves according to the
              snakes movement. The implementation boils down to a rather
              unprestigious while-if loop.

            <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-csharp">
    public void FindPath() {
      while(foodAmount > 0) {
        if(snake.transform.position.x &gt; food.transform.position.x)
          snake.SetDirection(Direction.left);
        else if(snake.transform.position.x &lt; food.transform.position.x)
          snake.SetDirection(Direction.right);

        if(snake.transform.position.y &gt; food.transform.position.y)
          snake.SetDirection(Direction.down);
        else if(snake.transform.position.y &lt; food.transform.position.y)
          snake.SetDirection(Direction.up);

      }
    }
