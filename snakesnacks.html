              Snake Snacks is a fun and quirky adaptation of the classic mobile
              game hit Snake. The idea emerged out of a desire to program a fun
              thing, so we brainstormed a bit. The idea that we ended up
              prototyping was Snake Snacks. Though it is still in a very basic
              state and pretty simple looking, playing the game is already quite
              fun! For Snake Snacks, I am the sole programmer with Lena
              providing ideas and concept art.

            <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase">The idea</h2>
            <p>
              In Snake Snacks, instead of controlling the snake itself, you
              place the green snacks and the snake finds it's own way to it. The
              snake is not very smart though, and thus it's up to the player to
              guide the snake in a way to avoid enemies and obstacles. If no
              snack is present, the snake will continously move forward, even
              biting it's own tail or running into enemies if not distracted by
              the placement of a new snack. A round of Snake Snacks is short,
              fun and engaging!

            <h3>Movement Controls</h3>
            <p>
              The snake in Snake Snacks is not very smart. In fact, it is rather
              predictable: It will always move vertically towards the food and
              then horizontally, but never turn around 180 degrees. Not only is
              this pattern rather simple to implement, it is also simple for the
              players to follow, predict and plan their moves according to the
              snakes movement. The implementation boils down to a rather
              unprestigious while-if loop.

            <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-csharp">
    public void OnLMBClick() {
      Vector3 pos = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition);
      if(food.Amount &lt; 1)
        food.Create(grid.WorldToCell(pos));
    }

    public void FindPath() {
      while(food.Amount > 0) {
        if(snake.transform.position.x &gt; food.transform.position.x)
          snake.SetDirection(Direction.left);
        else if(snake.transform.position.x &lt; food.transform.position.x)
          snake.SetDirection(Direction.right);

        if(snake.transform.position.y &gt; food.transform.position.y)
          snake.SetDirection(Direction.down);
        else if(snake.transform.position.y &lt; food.transform.position.y)
          snake.SetDirection(Direction.up);

      }
    }

              <p>
                Albeit only one of many possibilities, it's a sufficient
                solution for our cause. It's a predictable algorithm and not
                influencing perfomance. On click of the left mouse button, a
                food Object is created, if there is no other food object yet.
                This serves as a movement beacon for the snake, who will
                immediately try to get to the food Object. It will ignore any
                obstacles or it's own tail if it might intercept the path,
                therefore players must plan carefully and predict the snakes
                movement beforehand.

            <h3>Obstacles and Enemies</h3>
            <p>
              To make the gameplay more dynamic, we thought about implementing
              different enemies and obstacles. Two of those ideas made it into
              the game so far: The "Hedgehog", a stationary obstacle and the
              "Racoon", a thief who is trying to steal the snacks.
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-csharp">
    //A Dictionary containing Prefabs with EnemyTypes as Keys
    private Dictionary&lt;IEnemy, GameObject&gt; enemiesByType = new Dictionary&lt;IEnemy, GameObject&gt;();
    
    public void CreateEnemy(IEnemy type) {
      //The playing field is a 20x10 grid centered around 0, therefore the Range for the random position
      Vector2 randomPos = new Vector3(Random.Range(-10, 10), Random.Range(-5, 5));

      GameObject enemyObj = GetEnemyByType(type);
      if(enemyObj != null) {
        Instantiate(enemyObj, randomPos);
      }
      
    }

    public GameObject GetEnemyByType(IEnemy type) {
      if(enemiesByType.ContainsKey(type)) {
        return enemiesByType[type];
      } else return null;
    }
                </code></pre>
            <div class="contentwrap-project">

              <p>
                The hedgehog is a stationary enemy. It serves as a obstacle that
                players have to navigate around. In our prototype, the hedgehog
                is resembled by the red square. The racoon is portrayed by the
                yellow square. It will find a food in interest range and then
                move towards it, similarly to the snake. When the snake gets to
                the food first, the racoon will stop in place and wait for the
                next snack to appear. Otherwise, it will steal it and the snake
                will collide with the racoon if the player isn't reacting fast
                enough. If the food is too far away, it will also stay in place.
                Enemies are instantiated by utilizing a sort of mini-factory. A
                Dictionary-class holding all types of enemies. They can be
                fetched by calling a GetEnemyType function containing a proper
                enemy type.

              The idea emerged out of a brainstorming for fun minigames to
              prototype as a pastime activity. It is simply built and contains
              no complex logic, but it works and it's fun, two main requirements
              for a good game in my book! On a more serious note, working on
              Snake Snacks was a fun exercise, and it turned out to be so
              promising that it might grow into a fully fledged mobile game in
              the future. So far in the prototype, although no graphics were
              implemented, there's already 2 types of obstacles and the basic
              gameplay is fully implemented.
