              This game is the practical part of Lena's bachelor thesis. My
              responsibility for this project lies in programming and
              implementing her ideas. I also use this opportunity of being the
              sole programmer for a bigger project to work on my expertise and
              coding skills. For that, I researched basic programming patterns
              and design principles to apply into the project. Furthermore, I
              started implementing Unity play tests to get a grip of test driven
              development processes. So far, we could create a playable
              prototype of the base gameplay loop.

            <p>
              This project is a turnbased deckbuilding strategy game, similiar
              to chess but as a deckbuilder. Players can build a deck from a set
              of tiles, each of which have their own functionality, such as
              tiles that move other tiles, or tiles that can attack or defend.
              The goal is to capture the enemy crown by colliding an attack tile
              with it. Players are able to see each others hands as to plan out
              their moves ahead. Tiles also break after using them too often or
              acquiring too much damage on a tile. The project is made with
              Unity.

            <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase">The features</h2>
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>
              The game is controlled like a card game, meaning the player draws
              cards that resemble tiles and drag and drop them onto the playing
              field. Move-tiles can be placed anywhere, whereas defensive and
              offensive tiles can only be placed in a specific "placement zone".
              To save on resources, every time a tile is destroyed, it moves
              into the graveyard. Once all cards have been drawn, the graveyard
              is shuffled into the deck again. The graveyard serves as an object
              pool, meaning that rather than creating new instances, the old
              objects are reactivated to save on resources and performance.

              <p>
                The logic behind playing cards is fairly simple. The Card class
                is what is represented in the UI as cards on your hand. They
                have a draggable property and when dragged onto the playing
                field, the CardObject class' CreateInstance()-function is
                called. This summons a card object on the corresponding
                position. There is some collision handling in the backend to
                make sure that certain cards can't be put into certain places or
                on top of each other. Once placed on the field, card objects, or
                tiles, can interact with each other. Movement tiles move
                offensive tiles, whereas defensive tiles have other properties,
                like the wall repelling any offensive tiles back to it's
                position. Everytime a tile is used, durability is decremented.
                Offensive tiles get their durability only decremented when
                attacked by other attackers or towers.

            <h3>Finite State Machine</h3>
            <p>
              For the implementation of the turnbased logic, I made a simple
              finite state machine with 6 states, Draw, PlayerPlacement,
              PlayerMovement, EnemyPlacement, EnemyMovement and GameEnd. Each
              state has it's own class implementing the IState interface. Here
              is the implementation of this state machine:
            </p>
            <pre class="highlight"><code class="language-csharp">
    
    void Awake() {
      //Collection of all states
      var playerPlacement = new PlayerPlacementState(playerDeck);
      var playerMovement = new PlayerMovementState();
      var enemyPlacement = new EnemyPlacementState(enemyDeck);
      var enemyMovement = new EnemyMovementState();
      var draw = new DrawState(playerDeck, enemyDeck);
      var gameEnd = new GameEndState();

      //Transitions for each states added via AddTransition/At-function - first state is from, second state is to, third is condition
      At(playerPlacement, playerMovement, EndTurn());
      At(playerMovement, draw, MovementHandled());
      At(draw, enemyPlacement, EnemyHandIsFull());
      At(enemyPlacement, enemyMovement, EndTurn());
      At(enemyMovement, draw MovementHandled());
      At(draw, playerPlacement, PlayerHandIsFull());
      At(playerMovement, endGame, EnemyCrownCaptured());
      At(enemyMovement, endGame, PlayerCrownCaptured());

      //Conditions for state change
      Func&lt;bool&gt; EndTurn() => () => endTurn == true;
      Func&lt;bool&gt; MovementHandled() => () => MovementManager.NoViableMoves == true;
      Func&lt;bool&gt; PlayerHandIsFull() => () => playerDeck.handSize &gt;= 4;
      Func&lt;bool&gt; EnemyHandIsFull() => () => enemyDeck.handSize &gt;= 4;
      Func&lt;bool&gt; PlayerCrownCaptured() => () => playerCrown.IsAlive == false;
      Func&lt;bool&gt; EnemyCrownCaptured() => () => enemyCrown.IsAlive == false;
    }

    public void EndTurnButtonOnClick() {
      endTurn = true;
    }

    public void AddTransition(IState to, Func&lt;bool&gt; predicate) {
      transitions.Add(new Transition(to, predicate));
    }
                </code></pre>
            <div class="contentwrap-project">
              <img
                class="contentgif"
                src="assets/images/thesis-state.png"
                style="
                  max-height: 400px;
                  width: auto;
                  border-radius: 3px;
                  margin-bottom: 30px;
                "
              />
              <p>
                Core functions like drawing or triggering movement to happen is
                called from the corresponding states. In return, most conditions
                are returned from the classes the state machine is calling, like
                movement or card decks. The shown implementation is slightly
                simplified but breaks it down pretty much to how it works.
                Transitions are added from a state to another, meaning a
                transition will only work out of the state it is set from
                towards the state that it is added to, and only if the condition
                is met. Finite State Machines are no novelty and a clean
                solution for statebased or turnbased games. A state diagram of
                the state machine can be seen on the left.

              <p>
                For this project, I decided to research and implement elaborate
                unit tests to make testing, refining and refactoring features
                easier and improve workflow and code quality. For that, I wrote
                a number of tests for all core features and primary tile
                interaction. Running all current tests takes about 30 seconds
                and is fully automated. Tests are natively supported by Unity
                and can be run by the push of a button.

              Being able to be the sole programmer for a larger project gives me
              a great deal of freedom to work on my own accords. Lena's
              directions and design decisions are of course the driving factor
              for development, but the amount of flexibility allowed me to use
              this project as a learning opportunity. I used this to deepen my
              understanding of the principles of test driven development,
              design- and programming patterns and the SOLID-principles. Of
              course, the project is still in the prototype stage. So it is
              expected that the learning process will continue further during
              development of the game.
