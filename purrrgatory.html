          <h1>Escape from Purrrgatory</h1>
          <h3 style="color: #d7cfbe">
            Early 2021 marked the true beginning of my journey in game
            development. Escape from Purrrgatory was the first project outside
            of personal prototypes and mini projects that I had the opportunity
            to work on. I learned alot from my teammates about the whole process
            of developing a game from scratch. It was a valuable and fun
            experience that only further deepened my desire to develop games.

            <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase">The idea</h2>
            <p>
              Escape from Purrrgatory is a turn based isometric tactics game in
              which you control 4 characters at the same time. The characters
              are bound to each other and standing back to back. They all move
              and attack at the same time. The characters can be rotated in
              either clockwise or counterclockwise directions. Whenever the
              characters attack, they lose attackpower for the next attack.
              After issuing 2 moves while in interest range of an enemy, the
              turn ends and all enemies move and possibly attack. After the
              enemy turn, the gameplay loop starts over with the player turn.

            <p>
              The whole idea for the games' design was thought out by Lena.
              Anastasiia and Lena discussed and decided on the art direction
              together. To keep things organized, we utilized a Trello board.
              Daniil and I held regular feature meetings to discuss splitting up
              the tasks between us and reviewing implemented features. It was
              very helpful to work together with a seasoned programmer as I
              learned alot about writing cleaner code and keeping perfomance in
              mind thanks to Daniil's feedbacks. Finally we ended up with a
              finished introduction level including dialogs, AI Pathfinding, UI
              implementation and all major gameplay features such as powerups
              and three different types of enemies.

              The game is fully controlled with the mouse. Attacking and turning
              works via UI buttons, whereas movement is done by clicking on a
              valid movement tile. Two basic functions handled the logic for
              finding valid movement options:

                    public void CheckPossibleMovements() {
                      for(int i = 0; i &lt; directionArray.Length; i++) {
                        if(CheckForCollidableObjects(directionArray[i], collidableObjects))
                          possibleMoveTiles[i].SetActive(false);
                        else
                          possibleMoveTiles[i].SetActive(true);
                      }
                    }
                    private void CheckForCollidableObjects(Vector3 direction, LayerMask layer) {
                      Collider2D col; 
                      foreach(Transform character in Characters) 
                      { 
                        col = Physics2D.OverlapPointc(character.position + direction, layer); 
                        if (col != null) 
                          return true; 
                      } 
                      return false; 
                    }
