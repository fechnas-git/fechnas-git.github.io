          <h1>Sound Design</h1>
          <p>
            In this section, I'd like to showcase some of my composing and sound
            design work. I started focusing on sound design for video games
            after finishing Escape from Purrrgatory, since I already did the
            sound design and music for this project. It will be showcased in the
            <a href="purrrgatory.html">Escape from Purrrgatory section.</a>
            <br />
            Here, I want to focus on my other composing and sound work outside
            of projects. Following are some of my compositions as well as the
            sound design for an infinite jump mobile game.

              This composition features background ambience. It's composed for a
              scene or environment of a river running down a forest in the
              mountains, instilling a feeling of calm and hope.

              This composition features an entry section and is then supposed to
              be looped around the one minute mark. It's composed for a scene or
              environment of a postapocalyptic city amidst a vast wasteland.

              In this track, which is meant for a trailer of some sorts, I
              recorded everything on one guitar, including percussions, on
              multiple tracks. It was a fun exercise for creative creation of
              percussion.

            <p>
              For this Infinite Jump style game, I did music and sound design.
              The sound design was done using various objects and sounds created
              with my voice. It was my first sound design exercise after Escape
              from Purrrgatory.
